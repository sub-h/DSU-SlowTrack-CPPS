1. Why is the '#' used along with the header file?
A. '#' tells the preprocessor to include the contents
of the standard input/output header in the program.
Edit: '#' is a pre-processor directive(or a command to the pre-preocessor). A pre-processor directive modifies the source file
before handing it over to the compiler.
Edit2: Examples of pre-processor directives:
#include: for including header files
#define: used for defining constants
#ifdef: allows conditional compilation
_FILE_: bult-in macros(fragment of code that is given a name
Edit 3: '#' is the command to the processor to include header files or define the values of constants.

Fig. 1.1:
Phase1:A C program is created using an editor such as vim and stored in the secondary storage device(hard disk).
Phase 2: When the code is compiled, at first, the Pre-processor refers to the pre-preocessor directives and goes as per
whatever pre-processor directives are mentioned(like '#include').
Phase 3:The compiler just converts the C program code into object code.
Phase 4:Linking of the object code to the standard libraries or any private library so that the code maybe executed more easily.
Phase 5:The object code is 'Loaded' into the memory.
Phase 6:The program is executed one instruction at a time. If there isn't any syntax or run-time error, the output will be
given when the ./a.out command is typed and executed at the command prompt window.

Day2 questions and answers:
What is a variable?
A. A variable is a storage of memory which has a particular name. Unlike a constant, the value of a 
variable can change depending on the program code.
What is the data-type of a variable?
A. The data-type of a variable is the particluar type of value a variable can hold.
What are the basic types of a variable in C?
A. integer(int),double,floating point,character(char), String,long<datatype>.
